## Summary
  ### How many roles will needs to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  Pewlett-Hackard has 72.458 employees eligible for retirement during the "silver tsunami" that will need to be filled. Considering the size of the company is around 300,000 employees this accounts for 24% of their staff. Pewlett-Hackard will need to have a plan in place to fill these positions as they become available in order to minimize the impact a vacancy in so many positions will cause. 
  
  ### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  Only 2.13% of employees eligible for retirement qualify to be mentors for the mentorship program which will not be enough to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The mentorship is planned to be a part time offer for the mentors. The part time hours along with the small amount of eligible mentors will make it difficult for this program to meet the needs of the company. The company should continue to focus on developing the mentorship program to help minimize the impact of the "silver tsunami" however they may look to increase their parameters that allow employees to qualify to be a mentor.
